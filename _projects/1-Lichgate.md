Lichgate is a top-down action rogue-like where you fight hoards of enemies and upgrade your power to emerge victorious. It was made with [Coral Engine](https://github.com/GuusKemperman/CoralEngine), a custom engine me and my teammates made, but I talk more about that in the [Ability System V2 in Coral Engine](../projects/AbilitySystemV2CoralEngine) project, now it's about the creation of the game itself.
